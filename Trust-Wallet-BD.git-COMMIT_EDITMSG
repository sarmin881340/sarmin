Allow admins to delete users and associated data from the panel

Adds a new POST route `/admin/delete_user/:id` to handle user deletion. The route checks for admin session, finds the user by ID, and removes the user and their related payment, review, and message records from the database. The `user_information.ejs` view is updated to include a delete button with a confirmation prompt for each user.
